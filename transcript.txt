Alice:  Good morning,
Alice:  james; before we start the week I wanted to quickly review where things stand with the client dashboard update.
James:  Sure,
James:  Sarah.
James:  The development work is about eighty per cent done.
James:  The main challenge right now is the integration with the analytics a p i It's taking longer than expected.
Alice:  Got it.
Alice:  Do you need support with the integration or should we adjust the timeline slightly?
James:  A small time line adjustment would help.
James:  I expect we can finish everything by Wednesday if the api issues are resolved today.
Alice:  Perfect.
Alice:  Let's move the internal review to Thursday then.
Alice:  Thanks for the update,
Alice:  james.
